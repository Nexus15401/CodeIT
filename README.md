# 🚀 CodeIT - Learn Physics by Coding (Dual-Pane Interactive Sandbox)

**CodeIT** is an interactive learning app that teaches kids (ages 10–18) how physics works — by **writing real code to control a simulation**. Built with **Flutter**, this offline-first app features a **dual-pane interface**:
- ✍️ **Left side**: A simple code editor
- 🌍 **Right side**: A live physics environment

Students start with a floating ball in space.  
They learn how **gravity** works.  
Then, they **write the equation** to make the ball fall and **touch the ground**.

🎯 **Mission**: Make physics tangible. Turn equations into action. Learn by doing.

## 🔧 Features

🖥️ **Dual-Pane Interface**
- Code Editor (left) + Physics Simulator (right)
- Real-time feedback: code runs as you type

🪐 **Interactive Physics Sandbox**
- Start: A ball floats in space (zero gravity)
- Lesson: "Gravity pulls things down over time"
- Challenge: "Write code so the ball touches the floor!"

🧠 **Learn by Doing**
- Students write a simple equation like:
  ```python
  y = y + speed
  speed = speed + gravity
